  "blabble_description": "Blabble is a real-time chat application.<br /><br />Being quite familiar with REST APIs, I decided to develop this small project to learn how to build applications around <strong>GraphQL</strong>.<br /><br />I focused on the design of the different mutations and GraphQL queries and on the updating of the data in real time thanks to the subscription system.<br /><br />The backend uses the <strong>GraphQL Yoga</strong> library while the database modeling is done using the <strong>Prisma</strong> ORM.<br /><br />The <strong>TypeScript</strong> React application uses the <a href='https://react95.io' target='_blank'>React 95</a> UI library, which gives a retro feel that reminds me of years past when I was a kid in front of the old home Windows. It consumes the GraphQL API thanks to <strong>Apollo Server</strong>.",
